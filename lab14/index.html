	<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>With a partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> I honestly didn't have any issues with this lab I compared some old code where I had seuccessfully uploaded an image to lab 5 where I had failed to do so and found that I just had my image in the wrong place! Scratch that!! I just pushed to origin and on the actual website the image isn't visible. I just added a size adjustment so hopefully that works.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> It went smoothly heres a link to my debugged page!</p>
