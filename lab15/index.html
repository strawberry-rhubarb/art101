		<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Wow, I ran into a lot of problems working on this lab. I started by reading the lab assignment, then reading the lecture slides, then watching the recorded lecture, then referencing the jsfiddle and finally referencing Wes's site. At first I was able to program my API correctly, but I wasn't able to connect it to the button. Once I tried a few different lines of code and did a little bit of research I was able to load the API in the consule.log, but it wasn't displayed on the page like I wanted it. Finally after a lot of trial and error I was able to load the API on the index.html page. It took a lot of time and work but I was able to get it done!</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> See for yourself! Click my button :)</p>
