		<h1>Lab 16 - JSON and API's</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Working with your partner, experiment with processing JSON from an API.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>I was pretty confused about this lab at first because I was confused by what the comic was and what my output was supposed to be but after watching the lecture it made more sense. I wasn't sure how to "read the docs" because I couldn't find a tutorial on the website but after rewatching the lecture I understood what the goal of the assignment was better and I was able to figure it out. This assignment went relatively smoothly after that.
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>See for yourself</p>
