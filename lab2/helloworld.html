		<h1>Hello World</h1>

		<p>I have two partners on this assignment, Edith and Kayla. They are both really cool and we have section together. Kayla is a psychology major and Edith is a film major! Kayla's favorite color is yellow and Ediths is orange, my favorite color is green, I think it's neat that all of our favorite colors match nicely. Funnily enough we're all from Los Angeles! It's always fun to meet new people from back home and it definitely makes me feel a lot more secure in this classs. I'm looking forward to getting to know them more throughout this quarter!</p>
