		<h1>Lab 5: Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<img id="parkwood" src="img/parkwood.png" width=650 />
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables. To practice coding we described a type of car, I went with a 1959 Chevy Parkwood. </p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> So far I haven't had any issues on this assignment, I was worried that I was coding my js wrong in atom but then my teammates explained how atom js is different from chrome js. I still can't get my images to work on my lab 5 page, despite following the instructions and the way that I successfully configured it in lab 3.
			Edit: Debugged! </p>
