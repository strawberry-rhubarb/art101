		<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h1>
				<p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input and manipulate a string.</p>
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> The problem that we're having is that we can't get the script to show up in the browser. I've essentially followed the screenshot in the lab but it still isn't working. Edie and I have compared code both between us and between our codes from previous labs that were successful. However, we are still unable to display our script in the browser. I tried several tweaks just to test them but I didn't see a difference. I also went back to the notes for this lab but I didn't see any explicit errors in my code.</p>
