			<h1>Lab 9 - JavaScript for the Web</h1>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with DOM manipulation.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I ended up troubleshooting seperate from my partners but I honestly think it was for the best, I had to  solve all of mistakes myself which helped me learn more about why I made the changes I did. I actually enjoyed this lab quite a bit becuase I felt like i was solving a puzzle and it made me want to learn more about javascript.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Look at my buttons!</p>
